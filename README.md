# 🌾 Rainfall & Crop Production Analysis (Streamlit App)

### 📊 End-to-End Data Analysis & Visualization Prototype

This project is an interactive **Streamlit-based web application** designed to analyze the relationship between **rainfall patterns and agricultural crop production** across Indian states and districts.  

It demonstrates how data-driven insights can support **policy decisions** and help identify trends between climate and crop performance.

## 🚀 Features

### 🌧️ Compare Rainfall & Crops  
- Compare **average annual rainfall** between two states for the last _N years_.  
- Display **top M most-produced crops** in each state.  
- Uses combined rainfall and agricultural data.

### 🌾 District Crop Analysis  
- Identify **districts with highest and lowest crop production** for a given crop.  
- Compare production trends between two states.

### 📈 Crop vs Rainfall Trend  
- Analyze the **correlation between rainfall and crop yield** over years.  
- Interactive line and bar charts show production and rainfall variation.

### 🧩 Policy Comparison (Crop A vs Crop B)  
- Supports **data-backed policy decisions**.  
- Highlights differences in water requirement, yield trends, and climate suitability.
